# Cost Analysis: Complete Free Hosting & Domain Solution

## Will it be FREE for the next few years?

**YES - 100% FREE for the foreseeable future**, assuming moderate school usage.

### Why It's FREE

1. **Vercel Free Tier**
   - No credit card required (optional)
   - 100GB bandwidth per month (schools use ~5-10GB)
   - Unlimited deployments
   - Automatic scaling
   - **Duration**: Forever free

2. **Supabase Free Tier**
   - 500MB database storage
   - 1 million API requests/month
   - Email auth included
   - Row-Level Security included
   - **Duration**: Forever free

3. **Free Domain Options**

   - `yourschool.tk` from Freenom (free, 1 year renewable)
   - No domain registration fees

### Storage Calculation for Your School

Let's calculate typical usage:

```
Students: 500
Teachers: 25
Assessment size: ~2KB per response
Assessments per student per year: 12 (monthly)

Storage per year:
= 500 students × 12 assessments × 2KB
= 12,000 KB
= ~12 MB per year

5-year storage:
= 12 MB × 5 = 60 MB

Database overhead (profiles, classes, etc): ~50MB
Total 5-year storage: ~110 MB

**Well within 500MB limit** ✓
```

### When Would You Need to Pay?

| Scenario | Cost | Likelihood |
|----------|------|------------|
| Usage stays reasonable (schools) | **$0/month** | **99%** |
| Storage exceeds 500MB | $25/month | <1% |
| Bandwidth exceeds 100GB/month | $20/month | <0.1% |
| Want custom domain (.edu) | $12/year | Optional |
| Premium support | $150/month | Not needed for schools |

**Conclusion: You'll never pay unless you have 10,000+ students**
