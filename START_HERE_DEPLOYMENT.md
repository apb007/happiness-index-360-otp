## ⚡ 5-Minute Summary (The Simplest Version)

### What You're Doing:
Taking code from v0 → Put it on GitHub → Vercel makes it live on the internet

### The 3 Websites:
1. **GitHub.com** - Stores your code (like Google Drive)
2. **Vercel.com** - Hosts your website (makes it live)
3. **Supabase.com** - Your database (stores student data)

### The 5 Steps:
1. **Create GitHub account** → https://github.com/signup
2. **Create Vercel account** → https://vercel.com/signup (use GitHub login)
3. **Upload code to GitHub** → Download ZIP from v0 → GitHub web upload
4. **Deploy to Vercel** → Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub
5. **Connect database** → Add Supabase secrets to Vercel

### When It's Done:
Your app will be at: `https://happiness-index-360.vercel.app`
