# Your Complete Questions Answered

## Question 1: Will it be free for the next few years?

**ANSWER: YES - 100% FREE**

- **Vercel hosting**: Free tier forever
- **Supabase database**: Free tier forever (500MB storage)
- **Domain**: Free (Vercel subdomain or Freenom)

You only pay if you have:

- Custom domain like `.edu` (~$12/year, optional)

For a typical school: **Forever free**

**ANSWER: YES**

**Vercel Free Tier includes:**
- ✓ Unlimited deployments
- ✓ 100GB bandwidth/month (schools use ~5-10GB)
- ✓ Automatic HTTPS/SSL
- ✓ Global CDN
- ✓ Auto-scaling
- ✓ Serverless functions
- ✓ Environment variables

## Question 3: Is domain free?

**ANSWER: YES - 3 FREE OPTIONS**

### Option 1: Vercel Subdomain (BEST)
```
https://happiness-index-360.vercel.app
```
- Completely free
- Professional looking
- Automatic HTTPS
- Ready immediately
- **Recommended for schools**

### Option 2: Free Domain from Freenom
```
https://happiness-index-360.tk
https://happiness-index-360.ml
```
- Free for 1 year (renewable)
- Setup: 10 minutes
- More professional than .vercel.app
- Must renew annually (free)

### Option 3: Your School's Domain (Optional)
```
https://assessment.yourschool.edu
```
- Cost: ~$10-20/year (optional)
- Must already own domain
- Most professional
- Can use: assessment@yourschool.edu emails

**My recommendation**: Start with Vercel subdomain (free), upgrade to school domain later if desired.
