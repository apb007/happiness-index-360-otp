## Multi-School Setup

### For Districts: Manage Multiple Schools

**Scenario**: You manage 3 schools in your district

#### Setup Process:

**Create Admin Account Per School**

Option 1: One master admin with access to all
```
Admin email: district-admin@district.edu
Can create/manage: 3 schools
Sees: All school data
```

Option 2: Admin per school (more secure)
```
Admin 1: lincoln-admin@lincoln.edu → Lincoln High
Admin 2: central-admin@central.edu → Central Academy
Admin 3: riverside-admin@riverside.edu → Riverside High
```

**Each Admin Customizes Their School**

Admin 1 sets up Lincoln High:
- Uploads Lincoln logo
- Sets primary color to Lincoln blue
- Adds contact info
- Adds welcome message

Admin 2 sets up Central Academy:
- Uploads Central logo
- Sets primary color to Central green
- Adds contact info
- Adds welcome message

**Data is ALWAYS Isolated**

Lincoln students ≠ Central students (database RLS enforces this)
- Teachers only see their students
- Principals only see their school
- Admins see all their schools
